# NeuralNetPlayground
This is my personal project of playing around with complex game AIs, in this case the task is a resource-management strategy. Though this project is primarily for applying basic neural nets to common video game tasks, this project will contain many different solutions, such as state-machines, decision trees, data-driven logic, goal-driven logic, and even probability-based logic, or any combination thereof.
